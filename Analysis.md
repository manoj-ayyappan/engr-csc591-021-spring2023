Results:

Repgrid 1 

The first repgrid generated clusters for examples as:

-   {Violin, Guitar}

-   {Keyboard, Drums}

-   {Saxophone, Trumpet}

-   {Harmonica, Flute}

For the attributes it generated clusters as 

-   {Difficult to Play:Easy to Play, Attractive:Ugly}

-   {Max Size:Min Size, High Cost:Low Cost}

-   {Lots of Air Blowing:Minimal Air Blowing, Modern:Old }

-   {Safe:Unsafe, Max Plucking Sound:Min Plucking Sound}

In the matrix we had a cluster of Drums and Guitar. We also had a group where Harmonica, Trumpet, and flute were close to each other. The remaining 3 each took a corner.

Repgrid 2

The second repgrid generated clusters for examples as  

-   {Violin, Guitar}, 

-   {Drums, Keyboard}, 

-   {Saxophone, Trumpet}, 

-   {Harmonica, Flute}

For the attributes it generated clusters as 

-   {Most used:Least used, Max Size:Min size}, 

-   {Max difficulty:Least difficulty, Max Volume:Least Volume}, 

-   {Hardest Material:Softest Material, Max string Plucking:Min string Plucking}, 

-   {Most Likable:Least Likable, Least expensive:Most expensive}

In the matrix we had a cluster of Guitar and Keyboard. Flute and Harmonica, Trumpet and saxophone were also close to each other

Repgrid 3

The third repgrid generated clusters for examples as 

-   {Violin, Drums} 

-   {Harmonica, Guitar} 

-   {Trumpet, Keyboard} 

-   {Flute, Saxophone}

For the attributes it generated clusters as 

-   {Modern:Old , High Cost:Low Cost}

-   {Max Strings:Min Strings , High Melodic:Low Melodic} 

-   {Classical:Rock, Max Blowing Air:Min Blowing Air}

-   {High Aesthetic:Low Aesthetic, High Difficulty:Low Difficulty}

In the matrix we had a cluster of Harmonica and Flute. The Saxophone is close to the cluster as well. Rest all are distinctly separate.

Analysis:

The first two people had the same clusters generated for the example instruments. The third person's clusters were far off from what we had initially thought would be right. Somehow, violin and drums came in the same cluster. It was also shocking to see trumpet and keyboard in the same cluster. This showed us that we should never stick to our own assumptions. It was also interesting to see how the attributes clustered up for each of the people. We wanted to just see similarities between instruments but we ended up seeing some interesting correlations such as difficult to play instruments being attractive to one person. It was also exciting to see that for the third person, the most likable instrument was the least expensive. Many other pairings do make sense like having more strings gives more melody.
